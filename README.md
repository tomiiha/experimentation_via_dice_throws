# Experimentation via Dice Throws

A quick set of scripts to test out some automatic ways to run experimentation, metrics related to experimentation, and possible t-tests. All generated for fun, just to conceptualize approaches for some simple problems!

*Note: The scripts are not designed to always produce a meaningful result, and p-values are likely not going to be significant each time the scritps are run.*
